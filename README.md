## Intro

The [Epinoo Project](http://www.epinoo.gr/) is an initiative of the
[National Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr) and the
[Institute of Communications and Computer Systems](http://www.iccs.gr) in
collaboration with the [Municipality of Athens](https://www.cityofathens.gr/),
aimed at attracting novel ideas and supporting their evolution into commercially
viable products.

As part of its activities, the Epinoo Project has developed a software platform
to facilitate its operations. The Epinoo Platform is based on already existing
Open Source Software, such as Moodle, WordPress and Big Blue Button, integrated
for the purposes of Epinoo, along with specially developed software, such as
plugins and modules, to support its special needs.
